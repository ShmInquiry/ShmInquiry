- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShmInquiry
- 👀 I’m interested in backend and front-end dev
- 🌱 I’m currently learning backend
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on CyberSecurity projects for backend and frontend
- 📫 How to reach me sh.m.inquiry@outlook.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Ali
- ⚡ Fun fact: I do not believe in the 'self made man', or the 'self learning' concepts - because at the end, someone has to guide; either via book, youtube, or colleagues and teachers. Thanks.
