- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShmInquiry
- 👀 I’m interested in backend and front-end dev
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unconventional Fullstack development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Rust projects
- 📫 How to reach me Sh.M.Inquiry@outlook.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Leo (it is my dojo nickname)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I do not believe in the 'self made man', or the 'self learning' concepts - because at the end, someone has to guide; either via book, youtube, or colleagues and teachers. One thing that I know for certain; and it is that I know nothing.
